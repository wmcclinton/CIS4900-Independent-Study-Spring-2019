# CIS4900-Independent-Study-Spring-2019
This is the repository for my Independent Study Course during Spring 2019 semester. In this course I will be exploring the use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, specifically the use of high level options, in constructing procedures by which agents can discover new skills autonomously. In thesis repository I will keep documentation of my efforts including: Readings, Writings, and Projects done within the course. 

## Contents

### Readings
...Readings are broken up into 3 categories: **Future** (papers that I intend to read), **Present** (papers I am currently reading), and **Past** (papers I have read fully or skimmed). For the **Past** readings, 90% of them I've printed out a hard copy and have taken notes on; these tend to be the papers I have the most interest in.
...I've also read most of Sutton and Barto's [*Reinforcement Learnining: An Introduction*](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3S9BNFYPT7OLW&keywords=introduction+to+reinforcement+learning&qid=1550769479&s=gateway&sprefix=introduction+to+rei%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3), Maxim Lapan's [*Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-Q-networks-ebook/dp/B076H9VQH6/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3S9BNFYPT7OLW&keywords=introduction+to+reinforcement+learning&qid=1550769479&s=gateway&sprefix=introduction+to+rei%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1), and Pedro Domingo's [*The Master Algorithm*](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?crid=1ZMOBQXTJZ8X7&keywords=the+master+algorithm+by+pedro+domingos&qid=1550769536&s=gateway&sprefix=master+algori%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1-fkmrnull). They're great I recommend all of them to anyone interested in Reinforcement Learning.

### Projects
...This section contains personal projects that I've implemented within this course. These projects range from implementations of examples from Sutton and Barto's [*Reinforcement Learnining: An Introduction*](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3S9BNFYPT7OLW&keywords=introduction+to+reinforcement+learning&qid=1550769479&s=gateway&sprefix=introduction+to+rei%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3) and Maxim Lapan's [*Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-Q-networks-ebook/dp/B076H9VQH6/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3S9BNFYPT7OLW&keywords=introduction+to+reinforcement+learning&qid=1550769479&s=gateway&sprefix=introduction+to+rei%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1) books to personal projects I wanted to explore.

*Notes: I still need to add DRLHO stuff and exploratory Coursera Stuff. I also need to add short descriptions of the code uploaded.

### Certificates
...During my time in this course I've watched the full video playlist from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from Stanford and [Deep Learning Specialization Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from deeplearning.ai. Also I decided to complete the assignments for 4/5 deep learning specialization topics and attain certificates of completion from them.

### Writings
...This section is unfinished, and contains some random preliminary writings done for applications losely related to this class.
